## ⚙️ System & Architecture

- REST API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Input validation and error handling middleware
- Supabase PostgreSQL database integration
- JWT-based authentication (backend secured)
- Session persistence using localStorage
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Supabase keep-alive system (prevents free-tier sleep)
- Deployed on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Built and deployed a full-stack application end-to-end
- Designed REST API with authentication and middleware

## 🎨 Design & Development Process

- Layout prototyped in **Canva** and **Adobe Photoshop** for spacing and visual hierarchy
- Cafe section uses CSS text overlay on a full-background image
- Transitioned from static HTML/CSS/JS → React (Vite) + Node.js
- Database upgraded from in-memory storage → live Supabase PostgreSQL
- Reservation system upgraded with date/time picker, business hours validation,
  confirmation modal, toast notifications, and error modal
- Scroll system rebuilt from standard scrolling → custom parallax fade using
  `window.scrollY` and fixed CSS layers
- Admin panel separated into its own route via React Router DOM
- Deployed to Vercel + Render for full production availability
- AI-assisted tools used for debugging and workflow efficiency
